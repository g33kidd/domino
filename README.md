Domino
======

Domino is a beta development theme used by Themazing to experiment with while we work on our theme framework that is TBA.

We hav decided to slit the theme up into the following base heirarchy:

1. **functions:** Theme functions and libraries that power Domino's main features.
2. **assets:** Theme css, javascripts, images, and fonts.
3. **templates:** Template parts
4. **stylesheets:** When using domino-cli, use this folder for all Less and Sass files.


## How do I install domino?
Clone or download this repository and place it in your wp-content/themes/ directory of your WordPress installation.

## Using domino-cli (soon)
Install the domino-cli package: `npm install domino`

**Note:** This package is not available yet. Checkout the [repository](http://github.com/) and test it out locally.
